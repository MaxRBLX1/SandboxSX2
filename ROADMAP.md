## ✅ Completed Milestones

### v0.1 → EE CPU Skeleton
- Established emulator project structure
- Stubbed EE CPU core
- Defined modular architecture for future expansion

### v0.2 → Instruction Decoder + BIOS Loader
- Implemented instruction decoder framework
- Added BIOS loader support
- Verified initial boot sequence parsing

### v0.3 → Memory Map (RAM, Scratchpad, IOP)
- Defined RAM and scratchpad regions
- Integrated IOP memory mapping
- Validated memory access stubs

### v0.4 → GS / IOP / SPU2 Stubs
- Stubbed Graphics Synthesizer (GS)
- Stubbed IOP and SPU2 subsystems
- Prepared hooks for future audio/video integration

### v0.5 → Full VM Loop
- Achieved stable Full VM Loop
- BIOS boot with live debug overlay
- Demonstrated stability even on ultra-low-end hardware (e.g., Realme C11)

### v0.6 → Instruction Semantics
- **Core Arithmetic & Logic:** Implemented ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV, Logical ops, and Shifts (SLL, SRL, SRA)
- **Control Flow:** Implemented Branch and Jump instructions with Delay Slot handling
- **Memory Access:** Added Load/Store for word, halfword, and byte, plus Unaligned Access (LWL/LWR/SWL/SWR) and Scratchpad mapping
- **Special Registers:** HI/LO handling, PC updates, and COP0 Exception stubs
- **Exceptions & Traps:** Implemented basic exception framework with jumps to vector `0x80000000`

### v0.7 → Interrupts, Timers & DMA Refinement (100% DONE)
- **Interrupt Framework:** Implemented software INTC handling
- **Hardware Timers:** Refined for accurate scheduling with clock dividers
- **DMA Refinement:** Implemented Source Chain mode and DMAtag (CNT, NEXT, END) support
- **Core Sync:** Implemented 8:1 clock ratio synchronization between EE and IOP

## 🚧 Current Milestone

### v0.8 → GS Rendering Prototype + Hybrid JIT
- Begin GS rendering pipeline (Vulkan/GLES)
- Implement basic frame buffer output
- Hybrid JIT logic for "hot" instruction blocks to boost performance
- Debug overlay for GPU events

## 🌌 Future Milestones

### v0.9 → SPU2 Audio + IOP Expansion
- Integrate SPU2 audio playback
- Expand IOP subsystem functionality
- Synchronize audio with the VM loop

### v1.0 → Public Beta Release (Playable)
- Playable PS2 titles on all supported Android devices
- Full Sandbox Safety Layer
- Community-driven features and accessibility enhancements

# 🎮 SandboxSX2

**SandboxSX2** is a safe, universal **PlayStation 2 emulator for Android**, developed solo by **MaxRBLX1**.  
It follows a **"Universal First"** philosophy, optimized to run on **all devices**—from flagship phones to ultra-low-end hardware like the Realme C11.  

Using a **100% sandboxed core**, SandboxSX2 delivers **stable emulation without compromising device safety, privacy, or thermal performance**.

⚠️ **Note:** SandboxSX2 is currently a **BIOS loader and debugging platform**. Full PS2 game support will come in **v1.0 (Public Beta)**.

## 🚀 What’s New in v0.7

v0.7 is a **major milestone**, introducing the “Nervous System” of the emulator:

- **Interrupt Framework (INTC):** Full software-level handling for CPU interrupts  
- **Hardware Timers:** Accurate scheduling using clock dividers for realistic VM speed  
- **DMA Refinement:** Source Chain mode and full DMAtag (`CNT`, `NEXT`, `END`) support  
- **Core Synchronization:** Precise 8:1 clock ratio between EE and IOP processors  
- **Live Debug Overlay:** See PC, cycles, and GIF activity in real time  

v0.7 is **fully functional for BIOS boot and debugging**, but **games do not run yet**.

## 🌍 Mission: Emulation for Everyone

SandboxSX2 is designed for **millions of users on budget devices**:

- **Universal Compatibility:** Android 6.0+ (including Android Go), ARM and x86 CPUs  
- **Safe by Design:** Runs entirely in a sandbox; no root, kernel hacks, or unsafe overclocks  
- **Efficient & Ethical:** No ads, no trackers, optimized C++ code prevents overheating  

---

## **Key Features (v0.7)**

SandboxSX2 v0.7 introduces the emulator’s **core "nervous system"**, enabling accurate hardware emulation and advanced debugging:

### **Sandboxed Core Architecture**
- Fully isolated emulation of PS2 hardware from the host device.  
- Ensures OS stability even on low-RAM devices.  
- Prevents uncontrolled hardware access and privacy risks.  
- Deterministic execution for reliable debugging and testing.

### **Interrupt Framework (INTC)**
- Emulates PS2 interrupt request handling with mask and prioritization logic.  
- Interrupts delivered deterministically to the Emotion Engine (EE).  
- Supports step-by-step tracing for debugging CPU behavior.

### **Hardware Timers**
- Accurate cycle-based emulation of PS2 hardware timers.  
- Enables precise scheduling for DMA, audio, and future GPU operations.  
- Facilitates synchronization testing and timing analysis.

### **DMA Refinement**
- Controlled transfers between CPU, memory, and subsystems.  
- Synchronization-aware execution prevents race conditions.  
- Optimized for stability on low-end devices.

### **Core Synchronization**
- Centralized VM loop synchronizes CPU, timers, and DMA subsystems.  
- Stable execution with safe pause, resume, and reset functionality.  
- Provides a consistent platform for debugging and hardware validation.

### **Live Debug Overlay**
- Real-time visualization of CPU execution, interrupts, timers, and DMA activity.  
- Memory access and execution state inspection for developer analysis.

## ⚠️ BIOS / .BIN Files Required

SandboxSX2 **requires official PlayStation 2 BIOS files** in `.bin` format. These are **not included**.

- **Required:** `scphXXXX.bin` (Main BIOS)  
- **Optional:** `rom1.bin`, `rom2.bin`, `erom.bin`, `nvm.bin`, `mec.bin`  

 **How to copy BIOS files:**  
 - 1. Open **ZArchiver** or any file manager on your device.  
 - 2. Go to your **Downloads** folder.  
 - 3. Find the `.bin` BIOS file, then **hold/tap and copy** (depending on your file manager).  
 - 4. Navigate to:  
     ```
     Android/Data/com.maxrblx1.sandboxsx2/files/ps2_bios
     ```  
 - 5. Paste the `.bin` file here.  

 - ⚠️ If you don’t have a BIOS file yet, you can download a free PS2 BIOS from the internet (make sure it is `.bin`).  
   Missing optional files may reduce compatibility with some games but will **not prevent the emulator from running BIOS/debug**.
